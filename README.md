# Draw Bot Encoding

It will ask you to select a PNG image. It will encode it into 512 character long strings that can be copied into 
RecRoom, decoded and used in a CV2 image printer. 
If the image is not yet dithered, get the closes RecRoom color to every pixel. This results in a very flat looking image and fast print times due to there being no dithering. For dithering I suggest Photoshop (using included ACO files) or gimp.

CV2 image printer room will be published some time in the future under the name ^ImagePrinterBot
