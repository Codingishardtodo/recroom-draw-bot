# Draw Bot Encoding

It will ask you to select an .png image. It will encode it into 512 character long strings that can be copied into 
RecRoom and decoded and used in an CV2 image printer.  

This branch features experimental converting real image colors into RecRoom clors. It does not dither the image so the image may look weird.
